# SwipeSaver

## What is it?
Swipesaver is a web application that allows users to collaborate and rate different meals at RPI dining halls.

## How does it work
Our web app scrapes information off of RPI's meal website using beautifulsoup and django python to cleanly display and organize meals, as well as allow them to be rated, with the option for users to upload images of their meals.

## Features currently being added...
Potential features to be added include:

1. Location based dining hall finding for convenience
2. Highest rated items displayed
3. Search options for specific food items
